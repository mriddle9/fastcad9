    <h2>About WinTest</h2>

    <p>
        WinTest is a program that I'm using to explore the basic UI design issues for a next generation
        program.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is an alpha-transparency window based application with its own title bar that allows window
        drag and drop by dragging the title bar text area, provides the usual title bar icon behavior,
        and supports all edge and corner drag resizing and repositioning.
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose for this is to allow more flexibility in the title bar appearance, and the ability to make use
        of title bar space for additional controls or information display.
    </p>

    <h2>Testing Different Renderers</h2>

    <p>
        By commenting all but a chosen wstyle value in the CApplication constructor, it is possible to
        test a variety of renderers, including GDI+ and DX2D, as well as other options with the CIDraw
        software renderer which supports the WSTYLE_ALPHA work described above, and to attempt to make
        code that works in all cases, so this could be a user option.
    </p>
    <p>
        The GDI+ and DX2d renderers support proper Arabic joiners in text. All renderers now properly
        support Bi-Directional mixed text, and the saple text page display shows this.
    </p>

    <h2>Printer Support</h2>
    <p>
        The displayed text page displays current system printer information. Menu options for printing tests
        have been copied from the evtk3apps::printtest app to provide early access to printing, so that print 
	fucnctionality can be tested as the program develops, rather than being bolted on later.
    </p>

    <p>
	These tests verify that text can be printed, and that bidirectional mixed mode text can be printed if a 
	font that supports Unicode text is selected. Additionaly, sample code prints a page of graphics correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Help</h2>
    <p>
        By providing HTML help from the start, the help system can be developed in parallel
        with the code, so that details do not get lost.
