FCW9 Issues
========================================================================
12-7-24:
Menus on Linux build do not stay open with top menu click
(click on menu name, then another click on menu item)
(Windows dos both two clicks and single click-drag-release)

Linux build, starts ok from WSL command line with window shown 
on W10 screen, but is fairly small title, menu bars)

wintest: linux builds crash if try to print (uses cups) on WSL.
Test on desktop linux to see if it works there

wintest: won't build debugso64, releaseso64. Need to figure
out how these should work. evtk4src is not building D64 nor Dd64 libs.

We know we will want plug-ins, so probably should make DLL builds from 
start, but all of the core should be MD not D libs, so no DLLs needed, 
unless to support 3rd party DLL-required libs.
