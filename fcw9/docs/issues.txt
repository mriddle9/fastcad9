FCW9 Issues
=============================================================
12-7-24:
Menus on Linux build do not stay open with top menu click
(click on menu name, then another click on menu item)
(Windows dos both two clicks and single click-drag-release)

Linux build, starts ok from command linw with window shown 
on W10 screen, but is fairly small title, menu bars)
